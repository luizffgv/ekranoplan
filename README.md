# Ekranoplan

Ekranoplan is a general purpose JavaScript/TypeScript library for reducing
boilerplate and complexity in your code, and also providing more specific and/or
advanced features so you don't have to code them yourself.

## Why is it called ekranoplan though?

An ekranoplan is a type of aircraft that uses the ground effect to fly. What
can an aircraft have in common with a JavaScript library? Well, nothing really.
I guess both look cooler than they really are?
